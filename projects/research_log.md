# Research Log - VLA Memory

---
## Entry 0 (context / progress so far)
- Goal: reduce catastrophic forgetting in sequential training using PKM-style memory layers on SmolVLA (continual multi-task adaptation).
- Found: **standard PKM with static value vectors** could achieve ~zero interference, but performance plateaued (~30% success/task) → likely insufficient expressivity.
- Switched to **PKM “values” as mixture of tiny LoRAs** (`value_type=lora`, rank 2–4). Capacity constraints (fewer slots) coincided with interference returning; later also observed interference even when slot count matched.
- Tried mitigations:
  - **Query contrastive loss** (centroid) to separate routing → little benefit.
  - **Slot output corruption** for robustness to drift → limited benefit.
  - Started experimenting with **seeding sequential TF‑IDF/IDF from pretrain memory usage stats**.
- Off the table: hard task masking / task-boundary slot allocation, EWC, replay.

## Entry 1 — 11 Feb 26 (analysis + next experiments)
### Summary of the problem
- Sequential training updates only memory values/LoRA params (router frozen). We observed **high slot overlap at read-time** and a **shared “hot core”** used by all tasks (router collapse / MoE-like load imbalance).
- TF‑IDF masking mostly prevents *writing* into that shared core, but tasks still *read* heavily from it, and overlap remains large outside the strict all-task intersection.

### Evidence from sequential logs (tasks 6–9; layers 14 & 15)
- Access overlap (intersection/min) across tasks (treating `(layer,slot)` as distinct): ~**0.62–0.72**.
- Update overlap is lower with TF‑IDF: ~**0.16–0.31** (intersection/min).
- Shared hot core exists:
  - Layer 14: intersection of top-512 accessed across tasks = **134 slots**, contributing **~26–34%** of all accesses per task.
  - Layer 15: intersection of top-512 accessed across tasks = **172 slots**, contributing **~43–48%** of all accesses per task.
- TF‑IDF mostly protects the core (fraction of updates landing in access-core top-512 intersection is small, typically **≤3%**; and intersection of top-512 updated slots across all 4 tasks is **empty**).

### Design decision / hypothesis
- Forgetting is driven less by “writing into the global core” (TF‑IDF already reduces this) and more by **router collapse / shared read-time dependence** + overlap in the non-core set (worse with LoRA-values since shared slots implement shared transforms).
- Aim: keep a small universal core but increase **conditional routing separation** (task/instruction-conditioned hot sets), mainly during pretraining (contrastive is ineffective in single-task sequential batches).

### Next experiment being run (pretraining)
- Script: `job_scripts/smolvla-memory/pretrain/2_layer/pretrain_2_wide_film_dropout_high_lora_4_sample_contrastive_0.5.sh`
- Key knobs:
  - Memory on expert layers **[14,15]**, `value_type=lora`, `lora_rank=4`
  - `mem_n_keys=384`, `mem_heads=4`, `mem_knn=16`, `mem_k_dim=512`
  - Language-conditioned queries: `lang_to_query=true`, `fuse_method=film`, `embedding_model=all-mpnet-base-v2`
  - Increased exploration: `dropout_prob=0.1`
  - Stronger separation objective: `contrastive_method=sample`, `contrastive_loss_weight=0.5`

## Entry 2 - 25 Feb 26 (Simplified Experiments)

### Summary of the problem
Previously I was not systematically investigating the effects of each new feature on the performance. I have now run ablations across:
- Contrastive loss type (centroid vs sample-wise)
- Contrastive loss weight (0.5, 1, 2)
- Dropout probability (0.05, 0.1, 0.2)

Expirments run with Lora=4 and layers 12 and 14.

### Observations
- **Contrastive loss type:** No clear winner here. Centroid contrastive appears to exhibit less interference at later layers (e.g. layer 14) but slighly more in earlier layers. This is interesting - I thought we'd expect strictly more intersection from centroid.
- **Contrastive loss weight:** We appear to see the largest intersection for 0.5 (as expected), then significantly reduced intersection for 1.0, then oddly increased intersection for 2.0. Non-monotonic increase is confusing.
- **Dropout probability:** 0.05 experiment still running, but 0.2 performs better than 0.1 in terms of interference. Appears less degredation in previous task per, less intersection. This makes sense as some attempts to access slots important for previous tasks will be nullified by higher dropout.

### Thoughts
- Claude tells me that for sample-wise contrastive loss we are including some terms which encourage uniformity of the queries inside a given task **as well** as distance across tasks. This could be problematic if we saturate the query space. Could explain the non-monotonic behaviour of the sample contrastive loss weight. To test we are trying a loss that removes the positive pairs from the denominator.
- I also want to test the change caused by the lora r. Testing 2 to see if it makes any difference.
- I also want to test the effect of initialising the idf stats with the pretraining stats with different weights. Testing denom = 16 (e.g. 2x a single sequential task), 33 (1x seq task), 66 (0.5x seq task)

### Future
- In future I should test the effect of batch size. Due to memory constraints I'm limited in the batch size I can use for lora=4 which could affect the training dynamics of the query projections if not all the tasks are in the batch. Perhaps worth adding gradient checkpointing or something so I can increase batch size.
- Test corruption again. Seemed promising.
